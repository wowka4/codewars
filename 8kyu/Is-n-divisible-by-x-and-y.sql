/*Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.

Examples:
1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisib*/

-- You will be given a table 'kata' with columns 'id', 'n', 'x', and 'y'. 
-- Return the 'id' and your result in a column named 'res' using a SELECT statement.
-- You DON'T need to create a function, that's for other languages.
select id, n % x = 0 AND n % y = 0 AS res from kata
