/*Given three integers a, b, and c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the operators +, *, and parentheses (). In other words, try every combination of a, b, and c with the operators, without reordering the operands, and return the maximum value.

Example
With the numbers 1, 2, and 3, here are some possible expressions:

1 * (2 + 3) = 5
1 * 2 * 3 = 6
1 + 2 * 3 = 7
(1 + 2) * 3 = 9
The maximum value that can be obtained is 9.*/
